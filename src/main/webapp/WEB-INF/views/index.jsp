      <p class="role">Alumni</p>
      <p>After graduating from college, I started my career as an associate in a software company. The technical trainings and support provided during my college days encouraged me to progress in an IT environment. Even after my college days, the placement cell of our college continued to help me for the transitions from companies for the further growth of my career. Currently, I am working as a software engineer at Digitalsoft Pvt. Ltd.</p>
